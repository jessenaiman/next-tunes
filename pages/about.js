        Tickles and Tunes should feel like a comfortable gathering space for
        families and educators. We're going to share and learn new things
        together! As little ones discover their fingers and toes, and the world
        around them, we can encourage development by singing and celebrating
        along the way.
      </p>
      <p class="lead">
        This will be a safe, nurturing place where we try our best to use
        positive words. No matter who you are or where you're from, feel free to
        shake your sillies out for as long as you want!
      </p>
      <p class="lead">
        Please find something here to love, and then share something you love
        back. We're going to plant some seeds and watch them grow.
