      Tickles and Tunes should feel like a comfortable gathering space for families and educators. We're going to share
      and learn new things together! As little ones discover their fingers and toes, and the world around them, we can
      encourage development by singing and celebrating along the way.
    </p>
    <p className="lead">
      This will be a safe, nurturing place where we try our best to use positive words. No matter who you are or where
      you're from, feel free to shake your sillies out for as long as you want!
    </p>
    <p className="lead">
      Please find something here to love, and then share something you love back. We're going to plant some seeds and
      watch them grow.
